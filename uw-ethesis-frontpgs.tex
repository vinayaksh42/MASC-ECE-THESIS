\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

      The ubiquitous use of third-party libraries in software development has enabled developers to quickly add
      new functionality to their client software. Unfortunately, library usage also carries a cost in
      terms of software maintenance: library upgrades may include breaking changes, in which client expectations
      about library behaviour are no longer met in new library versions. Behavioural breaking
      changes can be particularly insidious, and in their full generality, could require sophisticated program
      analysis techniques to (approximately) detect.

      In this work, we present our UnCheckGuard tool, which detects a class of behavioural breaking changes---those
      related to exceptions thrown by Java libraries. UnCheckGuard analyzes both sides of the library/client
      duet. On the library side, UnCheckGuard creates a list of new exceptions that may be thrown by methods
      in a library's public API, including by its transitive callees. On the client side, UnCheckGuard identifies
      client methods that call library methods with new exceptions. To reduce false positives, UnCheckGuard
      additionally filters out new exceptions that cannot be triggered by particular clients, using taint analysis. It therefore can be
      used by client developers as a tool to screen library updates for relevant incompatibilities.

      We have evaluated UnCheckGuard on 69 libraries and 99 library-client pairs drawn from the DUETS collection
      and found 8 libraries with newly-added exceptions, as well as 49 callsites to library methods which,
      when upgraded to the latest version, may introduce
      a behavioural breaking change in the client due to a newly added unchecked exception. These findings
      highlight the practical value of UnCheckGuard in identifying exception-related incompatibilities
      introduced by library upgrades.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr. Patrik Lam for his unwavering support throughout every stage of my master's journey. His constant positivity and encouragement toward excellence made it possible for me to work on such an interesting topic. From narrowing down the research focus to perfecting the tool, he has guided me at every step of the research process. His mentorship has not only shaped the direction of my thesis but has also played a significant role in my growth as a researcher and academic.

I would also like to thank my parents and my sister for their continuous support. As professors, my parents have always inspired me to strive for academic excellence and have been a constant source of motivation throughout my life. My sister, in particular, has provided me with valuable advice on how to improve academically, which has been instrumental during this journey.

I am also grateful to the friends and individuals I have met along the way, whose support and encouragement have contributed to both my personal and academic well-being during this time.

Lastly, I would like to thank Dr. Weiyi Shang and Dr. Derek Rayside for their time and thoughtful feedback in reviewing my thesis.
